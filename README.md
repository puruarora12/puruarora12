Quick snapshot
- Name: Puru Arora
- Top languages across repos: Python, Java, JavaScript
- Main focus areas: AI Agents, algorithms (LeetCode), and computer vision/ML prototypes
- Most active / recently-updated repos: text_to_sql (2025-09-03), LeetCode-Java (2025-09-01), User_Next_Step_Predictor (2025-05-02)

About me
I work at the intersection of developer tooling, applied machine learning (NLP & vision), and content — building systems that make complex tasks simpler:
- Natural-language interfaces to data (Text → SQL)
- Predictive assistants that suggest the user's next action or automate repetitive workflows
- Algorithm practice and interview prep (Java)
- CV/ML notebooks and prototypes for learning and demos

Featured projects
(Highlighted to show what I actively maintain and what I want visitors to explore first)

- [text_to_sql](https://github.com/puruarora12/text_to_sql) — An intelligent chat interface that converts natural language questions into executable SQL. Uses modern language models to infer user intent and produce safe, useful queries so non-technical users can query databases naturally. (Language: Python — last updated: 2025-09-03)

- [User_Next_Step_Predictor](https://github.com/puruarora12/User_Next_Step_Predictor) — A small helper that learns common workflows and suggests the next command or action (works as a productivity assistant for repetitive command-line or web flows). Useful for intent prediction, completion, and skipping repeated steps. (Language: JavaScript — last updated: 2025-05-02)

- [LeetCode-Java](https://github.com/puruarora12/LeetCode-Java) — Collection of algorithm and data-structure solutions in Java for interview prep and explanation. (Language: Java — stars: 4 — last updated: 2025-09-01)

- [Active_Contours_Implementation](https://github.com/puruarora12/Active_Contours_Implementation) — Python implementation of active contour (snake) algorithms for image segmentation and energy-based contour fitting. Good reference for classic CV approaches. (last updated: 2023-12-17)

- [youtube_whatsapp_chatbot](https://github.com/puruarora12/youtube_whatsapp_chatbot) — Automation bot to connect YouTube updates to WhatsApp notifications; a practical example of small-scale automation and integration. (Language: Python — last updated: 2024-01-23)

Why these highlights
- text_to_sql and User_Next_Step_Predictor are my primary, ongoing efforts — they showcase applied NLP/LLM work (natural language → structured actions) and intelligent productivity tools (next-step prediction).
- I keep algorithm practice (LeetCode-Java) public as a learning artifact and reproducible reference.
- CV/ML repos demonstrate experimentation and reproducible notebooks.

Skills & tech stack
- Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript
- ML & NLP: Transformer-based LLMs, AI Agents prompt engineering, classic ML (scikit-learn), CV basics (OpenCV, active contours)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Docker (basic), small bots/integrations (APIs)
- Domains: Natural language interfaces, predictive assistants, algorithms & data structures, prototyping

Collaboration & opportunities
I'm interested in:
- Collaborating on user-facing ML tools (NLP → structured actions, query interfaces)
- Building assistants that predict or automate repetitive workflows
- Educational content and tutorial co-creation around applied ML and algorithms
